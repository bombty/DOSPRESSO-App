## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18+ with TypeScript and Vite. It employs Shadcn/ui (New York variant, Radix UI-based) adhering to Material Design 3 principles. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS, including dark mode support and Turkish localization. Typography features Inter for UI and Roboto for numeric data. The design prioritizes a mobile-first approach, ensuring responsiveness across tablet and desktop viewports.
