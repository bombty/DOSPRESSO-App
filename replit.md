- ChatGPT + Claude geçici devre dışı, sadece Replit Agent ile ilerlenir.
- Plan/Build mode ayrımı titiz: DB write, schema, migration, env değişiklik için Plan moduna geçiş + isolated task agent + backup + dry-run + GO zorunlu.
- DOCS-ONLY işler Build modunda yapılabilir (plan dosyaları, audit, runbook, skill güncelleme).
- Force push yasak; commit/push owner Replit Shell'den manuel.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite, utilizing Shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, CVA, and Lucide icons for a modern interface. It employs a modular layout featuring `ModuleLayout`, `ModuleSidebar`, and `KPIStrip` for structured content, alongside 6 role-based Mission Control dashboards. The design emphasizes mobile responsiveness, touch-friendly interactions, and role-specific quick actions. A server-driven collapsible sidebar dynamically generates navigation menus based on user roles and module feature flags.

### Technical Implementations
- **Authentication:** Session-based authentication via Passport.js supports both web (username/password with bcrypt) and kiosk (PIN-based with bcrypt) logins, incorporating security measures like password stripping, account lockout, and status management.
- **Role System:** A robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system manages 31 roles across HQ, branches, and the factory. Permissions are defined through a static map, and `module_flags` offer granular control over module visibility, with access managed via the `role_module_permissions` DB table.
- **Database Schema:** The data model is extensive, organized into 24 modular schema files defining 465 `pgTable` covering users, roles, HR, academy, factory operations, CRM, finance, and branch recipe system.
- **Key Architectural Patterns:**
    - **Soft Deletion:** Implemented using a `deleted_at` column across all core business tables.
    - **Data Locking:** Employs time and status-based data locking, supported by a change request workflow.
    - **Query Pattern:** Standardized usage of TanStack Query with `queryKey: ['/api/endpoint']`.
    - **Mutations:** `apiRequest` from `@lib/queryClient` is used for mutations, consistently followed by cache invalidation.

### Feature Specifications
- **Task System:** Features comprehensive task assignment, comments, evidence, status tracking, recurring tasks, bulk creation, verification, and rating, with CRM integration.
- **Production Planning:** Manages weekly production plans, items, daily records, and responsibilities, incorporating an approval hierarchy.
- **CRM:** A unified platform for communication, traditional CRM functions, and guest feedback, including QR feedback and task integration.
- **Academy:** A multi-version Learning Management System providing modules, quizzes, AI assistance, learning paths, certificates, badges, and analytics.
- **Factory:** Supports kiosk operations, shift management, quality control, lot tracking, station benchmarks, production batches, and worker scoring.
- **HR:** Manages the complete employee lifecycle, including documents, disciplinary actions, onboarding, attendance, leaves, and payroll.
- **Mr. Dobody (AI Agent):** A proactive AI agent designed for gap detection, task assignment, and workflow automation across operational categories.
- **Notification System:** A four-level notification system (operational, tactical, strategic, personal) with role-based filtering, category-based frequency control, archiving, and push notifications.
- **Mission Control Dashboards:** Six role-based dashboards deliver critical KPIs and insights through monthly snapshots of branch and factory performance.
- **Komuta Merkezi 2.0 (Dynamic Dashboard System):** A widget-based dashboard infrastructure with 24 registered widgets across 7 categories. It uses `dashboard_widgets` for registry and `dashboard_role_widgets` for per-role assignments. A unified API endpoint `GET /api/me/dashboard-data` delivers role-tailored widgets with real data, KPIs, and quick actions.
- **Late Arrival Detection:** Branch-scoped tolerance is dynamic via `branch_kiosk_settings.lateToleranceMinutes`.
- **Branch Attendance and Overtime Approval:** Managed via `branch_kiosk_settings` and `overtime_requests` tables with associated API endpoints and UI.
- **Route Guards:** All authenticated routes are role-restricted via `ProtectedRoute`/`HQOnly`/`ExecutiveOnly`/`ModuleGuard`/`FabrikaOnly` with an audit script for coverage.
- **Attendance Settings Audit:** Changes to branch kiosk/attendance settings are logged in `attendance_settings_audit` table.
- **Kiosk PIN Coverage:** Manages and audits PINs for staff, with a migration script for seeding and ensuring coverage.
- **Branch Recipe System:** A fully independent recipe system for branches with its own set of tables (`branch_products`, `branch_recipes`, etc.), API endpoints, visual asset management, and UI. It supports templates and aroma compatibility.

## External Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for AI vision, chat, embeddings, and summarization.
- **AWS S3 / Replit Object Storage**: Cloud-based storage for files.
- **Neon Database**: Provides serverless PostgreSQL database services.
- **IONOS SMTP**: Used for sending email notifications.
