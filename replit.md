### System Architecture

#### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18+ with TypeScript and Vite. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui (New York variant) based on Radix UI, adhering to Material Design 3 principles. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS with dark mode support and Turkish language. Typography uses Inter for UI and Roboto for numeric data. Responsive design is mobile-first using tablet (md) and desktop (lg) breakpoints.

#### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query (state), React Hook Form (forms), Shadcn/ui (components)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript, Replit Auth (OpenID), Passport.js session management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless), Drizzle ORM with type safety, pgvector for embeddings
- **Charts/Analytics**: Recharts for visualizations
- **File Upload**: Uppy + AWS S3 (ObjectUploader component)
- **QR Code**: html5-qrcode for scanning
- **Background Jobs**: Node.js interval-based scheduling (every 10-15 minutes)

#### Data Model
- **Equipment**: id, name, type, branch, health_score, warranty_date, maintenance_schedule, fault_protocol
- **Equipment Faults**: id, equipment_id, priority, status, current_stage, assigned_to, created_at, resolved_at, sla_breached, photoUrl, estimatedCost, actualCost
- **Troubleshooting Steps**: id, equipment_type, steps (array), created_by, admin-managed
- **Fault History**: id, fault_id, old_stage, new_stage, changed_by, changed_at, reason

#### Key Design Choices
1. **Health Score Calculation**: Real-time, based on recent faults + compliance metrics
2. **SLA Calculation**: Time-based (createdAt vs current time), varies by priority
3. **Fault Routing**: Smart routing to HQ/Branch based on equipment.faultProtocol field
4. **Notifications**: Automatic in-app alerts to relevant teams (no email yet)
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state sync, localStorage for theme
6. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (14 roles), branch-level data filtering
7. **Photo Upload**: ObjectUploader component using AWS S3 for persistent storage
8. **Fault History**: Last 5 faults displayed with date/time and priority badges
